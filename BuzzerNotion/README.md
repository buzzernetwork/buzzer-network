# BuzzerNotion Archive

This directory contains archived documentation that was originally created in Notion and has been organized into the main `docs/` folder structure.

## Migration Status ✅

All markdown files from this directory have been moved to their appropriate locations in the `docs/` folder:

### Research Documents → `docs/01_research/`
- **blockchain_ad_networks_research.md** - Analysis of blockchain-based ad networks (Brave, AdEx, Bitmedia, Varanida, Adshares, X402, THEMIS, Idena, Coinzilla, A-Ads)
- **ad_network_research.md** - Research on traditional ad networks (Google AdSense, Facebook Audience Network, Taboola, Adsterra, Airpush, SpotX, Undertone, AdCombo)
- **market_opportunity_analysis.md** - Market sizing, TAM/SAM/SOM analysis, publisher pain points
- **competitive_positioning_strategy.md** - Competitive positioning vs Google Ads and Facebook Ads

### Product Documents → `docs/02_product/`
- **buzzer_network_overview.md** - Main overview document with table of contents and product development roadmap

### Launch Documents → `docs/09_launch/`
- **successful_token_launches.md** - Case studies of successful token launches (Uniswap, ApeCoin, Arbitrum, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Chainlink, Polkadot)

## Remaining Files

This directory may still contain:
- Image files and folders (screenshots, diagrams)
- Empty subdirectories from the original Notion export structure

These can be cleaned up or moved if needed, but the main content has been organized into the docs structure.

## Note

The original Notion file structure has been flattened and reorganized to match the project's documentation structure. Links in the moved files may need to be updated to reflect their new locations.
