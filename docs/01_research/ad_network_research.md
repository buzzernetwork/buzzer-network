**Google AdSense revenue model and fee structure**

- Google AdSense has undergone significant modernization in its payment model. Historically, publishers received 68% of revenue for display ads and 51% for search ads. The platform has introduced a restructured revenue share model that separates buy-side and sell-side fees. Under this new framework, publishers now receive **80% of revenue for display ads after the advertiser platform takes its cut**. For ads purchased directly through Google, the tech giant retains approximately 15% on average, though this varies based on advertiser payment structures.
- A critical shift occurred in 2024 when AdSense transitioned from Cost-Per-Click (CPC) to Cost-Per-Mille (CPM) payment models, moving toward impression-based compensation rather than click-based revenue. This transition standardizes payments across Google's suite and third-party services, enabling publishers to directly compare earnings potential across different ad technologies. In the CPC model, advertisers pay only for clicks, making it performance-focused. The CPM model charges $X for every 1,000 impressions, regardless of user interaction. For publishers with lower click-through rates (below 1%) but valuable audiences, CPM can be superior as it guarantees payment per impression regardless of engagement.
- CPC models historically outperformed CPM for high-value audiences because advertisers bid higher for actionable metrics (clicks and conversions) compared to impressions alone. However, the dual-auction system in AdSense allows CPC and CPM ads to compete directly, with the platform displaying whichever generates higher expected revenue.

### Analyze Facebook Audience Network pricing and targeting

- Facebook Audience Network operates through flexible pricing models integrated with Facebook's broader advertising ecosystem. Ad costs typically range from **$0.50–$3.50 per click (CPC) or $12–$20 per 1,000 impressions (CPM)**. These figures vary significantly based on audience demographics, industry vertical, and ad quality scores.
- **Spend-based bidding** maximizes results within a set budget by finding the lowest average cost per conversion or targeting high-value conversions. **Goal-based bidding** pursues target conversion rates while allocating ad spend accordingly. Advertisers can also implement manual bid caps to prevent overspending beyond customer value thresholds.
- Audience Network enables precision targeting through multiple frameworks: **Core audiences** leverage demographics, interests, and behaviors to reach relevant populations at scale. **Custom audiences** retarget users who have interacted with the brand, visited the website, or engaged with social content. **Lookalike audiences** expand reach to users sharing characteristics with existing customers. **Interest-based targeting** connects ads with users' hobbies and preferences, while **behavioral targeting** reaches users based on purchase history and browsing patterns.
- Publishers utilizing the Audience Network report measurable improvements: Bombas achieved **20% higher return-on-ad-spend (ROAS) and 13% lower cost-per-acquisition (CPA)** compared to standard newsfeed placements. The platform's mobile-first approach (majority of placements on mobile devices) delivers lower cost-per-click than traditional Facebook ads, expanding reach while improving conversion economics.

### Research Taboola’s content discovery platform

- Taboola operates as a reverse-search content discovery engine, delivering proactive content recommendations rather than responding to user search queries. The platform processes **1 trillion monthly recommendations across 600 million+ unique visitors**, translating to approximately 500,000 recommendations per second. More recent data indicates Taboola serves **1.3 billion monthly unique users** globally.
- Taboola functions as a three-sided marketplace connecting content creators (advertisers), publishers, and the platform interface. Content creators drive traffic to their sites and pay for distribution as advertisers. Publishers integrate Taboola widgets (branded "Content You May Like," "Recommended for You," etc.) and earn revenue shares from clicks on external recommendations. The widgets display internal publisher content or external content, with publishers receiving payment for external referrals.
- High-profile publishers including Business Insider, MSN, Yahoo!, USA Today, Bloomberg, NBC News, The Independent, and The Weather Channel utilize Taboola for monetization.
- Taboola's proprietary algorithm analyzes content signals and matches them with users most likely to engage. The deep learning technology continuously refines targeting based on actual user reactions to recommendations. This approach positions Taboola as distinctly different from search engines—it anticipates user interests rather than requiring explicit search queries.
- AdCombo case study results demonstrate Taboola's effectiveness: CPA decreased 32% quarter-over-quarter for selected offers, traffic spend increased 6,000% QOQ, and approval rates were 10% better than Facebook.

### Study Adsterra’s global reach (30-35B impressions/month)

- Adsterra commands substantial scale in the global advertising ecosystem, processing **over 35 billion ad impressions monthly across 248 countries**. The platform serves over 35,000 direct publishers and 15,000+ brands, affiliates, and media agencies. Approximately **70% of impressions originate from mobile traffic**, reflecting the mobile-dominant consumption patterns.
- Popunders, social bar, in-page pushes, interstitials, video ads, banners, and native formats provide granular control over user engagement strategies. This format diversity enables optimization for different verticals and audience segments.
- The platform positions itself through a "Partner Care" approach, providing personalized support to publishers and advertisers. Publishers benefit from competitive payouts and a $5 minimum payout threshold, while advertisers leverage the CPA Goal feature to maintain campaign profitability. The network's anti-adblock technology recovers lost revenue for publishers facing ad blockers, which is increasingly important as ad blocking adoption grows.
- Adsterra's pricing spans from **$0.001 CPC to $0.30 CPM minimum**, with payment methods including PayPal, Wire Transfer, Credit Card, Paxum, and WebMoney. The $100 minimum deposit (sometimes lower for specific offers) makes the platform accessible to mid-tier advertisers

### Airpush’s mobile SDK approach (120K+ apps)

- Airpush operates one of the largest mobile advertising SDKs, integrated into **120,000+ live applications**. The platform is recognized as the second-largest Android ad network and the leader in monetization performance for both advertisers and developers.
- The Airpush Android SDK is a Java-based library enabling publishers to monetize apps through innovative ad units. Developers integrate the lightweight SDK to display ads while maintaining app performance. This integration approach contrasts with web-based platforms by operating at the application layer where developers have direct control over ad placement and user experience.
- **Smart Wall** is a full-page format dynamically optimizing between app wall, offer wall, dialog ads, video ads, and rich media based on performance. This algorithmic optimization increases publisher revenue by automatically selecting the highest-performing format for each user session.
- Publishers using Airpush's innovative ad formats report **10-30x higher returns compared to traditional in-app ads**. This substantial performance uplift stems from superior user engagement with non-intrusive, format-optimized placements.
- The platform includes Bugsense integration, offering real-time crash analytics and bug tracking services, providing developers comprehensive app health monitoring alongside advertising performance metrics.

- SpotX functions as a modern ad server with integrated programmatic infrastructure, data enablement, and monetization solutions for OTT (over-the-top), outstream, and addressable TV. Publishers and media owners leverage SpotX's control, transparency, and actionable insights to understand buyer behaviour, manage inventory access, and optimize pricing.
- The platform operates a real-time bidding (RTB) marketplace where publishers make video inventory available for programmatic purchase. SpotX completely rewrote its auction code, reducing primary auction times to **30-40 milliseconds**, enabling faster ad rendering and improving user experience. This technical optimization prevents multi-second ad delays common in traditional daisy-chain ad server implementations.
- SpotX introduced programmatic selling tools providing publishers unprecedented transparency: **Bid Activity Reports** identify highest-demand inventory segments based on advertiser bidding patterns. **Price Floor Optimization** suggests optimal price floors based on demand signals. **Pricing Rules** enable "if-then" business logic automating premium pricing for top-quality placements and discounts for lower-demand inventory
- SpotX integrates with major video players, ad servers, and demand-side platforms (DSPs). Partnership networks include comScore, DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science, JW Player, MediaMath, Nielsen, and Oracle, creating a comprehensive programmatic video ecosystem.

### Undertone’s cross-platform advertising

- Undertone specializes in immersive video and high-impact display ad units enabling brands to deliver engaging consumer experiences beyond traditional banner constraints. The company is recognized as a leader in cross-device advertising, developing responsive creative design (RCD) technology enabling ads to dynamically optimize for any screen size.
- RCD represents Undertone's core innovation, allowing web content (including ads) to flexibly respond to different device screens.

- AdCombo's partnership with Taboola achieved remarkable performance: 32% CPA reduction QOQ, 6,000% traffic spend increase QOQ, and dozens of successful client launches on the Taboola platform.

### Programmatic advertising trends

- Programmatic advertising has reached a critical inflection point in 2025. Global programmatic ad spend is projected to reach **$800 billion by 2028**, with 85% of total advertising revenue flowing through programmatic channels by 2029. U.S. digital video ad spend surged 18% year-over-year to $64 billion in 2024, with another 14% growth projected in 2025, reaching $72 billion—2-3x faster growth than overall programmatic spending.
- **Hybrid In-Housing Models**: Organizations are building internal programmatic capabilities while maintaining external partnerships. This hybrid approach balances control and efficiency, enabling companies to manage critical campaigns internally while outsourcing specialized or lower-priority media.
- **Connected TV and Digital-Out-of-Home (DOOH) Growth**: CTV and DOOH represent the fastest-growing programmatic channels. Adoption rates continue accelerating: 56% of global marketers are increasing CTV and OTT advertising spend in 2025, up from 53% in 2024, particularly in automotive, travel, pharma, and finance verticals.
- **Retail Media Networks Expansion**: Retail media networks represent the highest-margin programmatic opportunity. Walmart Connect and Amazon DSP leverage shopper data to serve programmatic ads with integrated checkout capabilities on smart TVs and other devices.
- **First-Party Data and Clean Rooms**: Cookies continue fading as the dominant identity layer. Marketers are prioritizing first-party data utilization and clean room architectures enabling brands to collaborate on privacy-compliant audience insights.
- **Alternative Identity Solutions**: Universal ID solutions create anonymized, consent-based identifiers for users without third-party cookies. These solutions require transparent communication about data usage, emphasizing consent and trust. Identity graphs aggregate and link data points tied to single consumers across multiple platforms, enabling targeting without cookies.
- **Artificial Intelligence in Campaign Optimization**: AI is now the engine rather than an accessory in programmatic advertising. AI-powered tools touch every workflow stage, from media buying to measurement. AI-powered creative testing can reduce timelines from weeks to days while accurately predicting creative-driven brand lift. By 2027, 55% of all ads will be AI-generated; metaverse ad spend will hit $20 billion by 2026; voice ad revenue will grow 400% by 2030.
- **Attention Metrics and Predictive Analytics**: Platforms increasingly measure ad attention rather than mere viewability. Attention-based metrics provide deeper campaign effectiveness insights than traditional viewability measurements, enabling better ROI optimization.
- **Supply-Path Optimization (SPO)**: Organizations are optimizing programmatic supply chains by identifying and prioritizing high-quality inventory paths. SPO reduces fraud, improves transparency, and increases effective CPM.
- **Brand Safety and Fraud Prevention**: Brand safety and fraud prevention have become non-negotiable requirements. Advanced tools identify risky inventory and fraudulent impressions, protecting advertiser investments.

### Retargeting campaign strategies

- Omnichannel retargeting uses multiple platforms and devices to reach audiences wherever they are—websites, social media, mobile apps, and offline channels like in-store visits. This approach reinforces brand awareness and increases conversion rates through consistent messaging across all touchpoints. Brands should use central customer data platforms (CDPs) to track behavior across all channels while tailoring ads to specific platforms (shorter, visual ads on mobile; longer-form on desktop).
- Dynamic retargeting displays ads featuring exact products or content users previously viewed. AI-driven personalization escalates this by using machine learning to predict and display products likely to drive conversions. Real-time ad content adjustment based on the user's most recent interactions maintains relevance, increasing click-through rates and conversion rates. Platforms should include upsell and cross-sell suggestions within dynamic ads.
- Email retargeting re-engages users who interacted with email campaigns but haven't completed desired actions. Advanced segmentation in 2025 enables targeting based on specific email behaviors (e.g., clicking product links but not purchasing). Seamless integration between email marketing platforms and retargeting systems enables unified multi-channel efforts increasing conversion.
- Frequency capping prevents ad fatigue by limiting impressions per user. Sequential retargeting guides users through planned ad series—initial ads reintroduce products, follow-ups highlight benefits, and final ads offer special deals. This narrative approach increases engagement compared to static retargeting.
- Video retargeting on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram Reels captures viewer attention more effectively than static formats. Video ads are inherently more engaging, making them ideal for retargeting campaigns targeting high-intent audiences.
- Geofencing technology targets users within specific physical location radii, particularly valuable for brick-and-mortar retailers. Combining geolocation data with behavioral data creates highly targeted ads resonating with local audiences, driving foot traffic to physical locations.
- Cross-platform retargeting ensures consistent messaging across all user devices and platforms. In 2025, unified ID solutions enable cross-platform tracking without third-party cookies. This approach maintains consistent brand experiences despite platform fragmentation.
- Successful retargeting requires audience segmentation based on specific behaviors (pages visited, time on site, actions taken), enabling more targeted messaging addressing each group's needs. Ad creative selection should prioritize formats aligning with campaign goals and audience preferences—display, video, social, or dynamic ads. All creative should include strong calls-to-action communicating next steps.
- Continuous A/B testing of different creative, messaging, and targeting approaches identifies resonating elements and drives higher conversions. Frequency caps prevent ad fatigue while maintaining positive brand perception. Regular audience segment reviews and refinement ensure targeting remains accurate. Advanced analytics tools provide deeper insights into user behavior and campaign performance, enabling data-driven optimization.
- Real-time bidding automates the buying and selling of individual ad impressions through rapid auctions occurring within **100-150 milliseconds**—roughly one-third of the time required to blink. When a user visits a webpage, the publisher's ad server initiates the process by sending bid requests to multiple demand partners simultaneously.
- The auction sequence proceeds as follows: The ad exchange collects incoming bids and applies any publisher floor prices. The exchange determines the winning bid (usually through second-price auctions where the winner pays the second-highest bid plus $0.01). The winning demand-side platform receives a win notice containing the final price. The DSP's ad markup is transmitted to the browser where the creative displays to the user.
- This entire process handles billions of daily transactions, with major exchanges processing over 600 billion bid requests daily.
- While often used interchangeably, programmatic buying and RTB represent distinct concepts. Programmatic buying refers to automated media purchasing across various platforms using machine technology and complex algorithms to optimize ad buying and spending on ad exchanges. RTB specifically describes real-time auctions for individual ad impressions where data-driven targeting enables precise audience matching.
- Programmatic buying encompasses three approaches: direct deals (agreed publisher-advertiser purchases), programmatic guaranteed (fixed-price campaigns), and programmatic open market (RTB auctions). Programmatic offers broader control with various bidding strategies, while RTB focuses exclusively on real-time auction-based purchasing.
- Private marketplaces represent an exclusive, invite-only variation of RTB offering premium publishers' curated inventory to select advertisers. Unlike open exchanges available to all buyers, PMPs restrict access to approved advertisers, ensuring higher-quality placements and controlled partnerships.
- **Preferred Deals** (right of first refusal) allow certain advertisers to buy premium space through the open market at predetermined prices, providing flexibility between programmatic automation and direct deal safety. **Programmatic Guaranteed** deals feature competitive bidding among selected advertisers with publisher-established floor prices, generally yielding higher CPMs than open exchanges. **Private Auctions** represent open bidding restricted to invited advertisers, giving publishers control over buyer access. **Auction Packages** bundle curated ad impressions sold under single deal IDs, aggregating impressions by demographics, interests, or content attributes.
- PMP benefits include enhanced transparency on purchased inventory and pricing, programmatic efficiency enabling rapid campaign launches, and preferential inventory access before public auctions.
- CPM charges advertisers $X for every 1,000 ad impressions regardless of clicks or conversions. The CPM calculation follows: CPM = (campaign cost / impressions) × 1,000. If a website charges a $10 CPM, it earns $10 per thousand impressions delivered.
- CPM works well for advertisers aiming to maximize reach and build brand awareness where visibility matters more than immediate action. For publishers, CPM guarantees payment regardless of user interaction, providing predictable revenue streams—critical for high-traffic properties monetizing at scale.
- However, CPM models require substantial traffic volumes to generate significant revenue, and publishers receive payment for non-viewable impressions, creating potential revenue leaks.
- CPC charges advertisers only when users click their ads, making it performance-driven and focused on engagement. The formula: CPC = campaign cost / clicks. Alternatively, CPC can be calculated from CPM and click-through rate: CPC = (CPM / 1000) / (CTR / 100) = (0.1 × CPM) / CTR.
- CPC benefits advertisers by charging only for actual user engagement rather than impressions. CPC works optimally for high-value audiences where advertisers will bid substantially to reach them. For publishers, CPC models reward strong click-through rates through higher per-click payouts.Conversely, CPC models require consistent traffic quality and engagement to achieve profitability. Publishers with lower CTRs face reduced earnings.
- CPA charges advertisers only when specific actions (sign-ups, purchases, lead form submissions) occur. This performance-focused model aligns advertiser costs directly with desired outcomes, creating transparent ROI measurement.
- CPA benefits include higher earnings potential from converting inventory and transparent performance metrics. The downside involves higher friction thresholds—users must complete specific actions rather than simply viewing or clicking ads. CPA typically achieves lower fill rates than CPM or CPC models.
- vCPM charges advertisers only for ads likely to be seen, calculated as: vCPM = (ad spend / viewable impressions) × 1000. This variation improves ROI by charging only for viewable inventory, encouraging publishers to optimize ad placement and page layout. vCPM typically exceeds standard CPM due to guaranteed viewability, requiring advanced attribution tools for implementation.
- The advertising technology landscape in 2025 represents a fundamental transition from third-party cookie dependence to privacy-first, first-party data-driven strategies powered by artificial intelligence. Platforms like Google AdSense, Facebook Audience Network, Taboola, Adsterra, Airpush, SpotX, Undertone, and AdCombo each address specific market segments—from publisher monetization to performance marketing—employing diverse revenue models and targeting approaches.
- Programmatic advertising dominates the media buying process through real-time bidding auctions, private marketplaces, and direct deals, processing billions of impressions daily with sub-150 millisecond auction cycles. Retargeting strategies have evolved from basic pixel-based approaches to sophisticated omnichannel campaigns leveraging AI personalization, sequential messaging, and unified identity solutions.
- Organizations successfully navigating this landscape combine multiple platforms, align revenue models with campaign objectives (CPM for awareness, CPC/CPA for performance), and adopt privacy-compliant identity frameworks. The convergence of CTV, retail media networks, and AI-generated creative represents the frontier of programmatic innovation, with 85% of advertising revenue projected to flow through programmatic channels by 2029.
