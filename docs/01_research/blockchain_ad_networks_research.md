# Blockchain-based ad network

### Brave Browser (BAT token) model

Brave integrates the Basic Attention Token (BAT) as the core currency mediating value transfer among users, advertisers, and publishers within its privacy-first browser. All ad purchases are made with BAT, and users receive rewards in BAT for their attention to ads. Notably, the BAT model is fully on-chain (Ethereum and Solana), with no additional token creation beyond the initial 1.5 billion minted. Of earned BAT, 70% is distributed to users, and 30% goes to publishers and advertisers. Brave’s approach keeps all user data local to devices, ensuring privacy and minimizing fraud risks. Brave’s recent innovations include BAT staking, a native DEX, SDK integrations for merchants, NFT support, and an in-browser wallet for crypto management—further broadening utility and liquidity for BAT.

### AdEx Network’s decentralized marketplace

AdEx operates as a fully decentralized ad marketplace, connecting advertisers and publishers directly through smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries. Built on blockchain, AdEx ensures transparency, privacy, and fraud resistance using on-chain verifiable reporting and advanced staking models. Features include zero-knowledge privacy for users, AI-driven ad optimization, customizable market instances (allowing private or exclusive campaigns), and rigorous health monitoring by validating nodes. AdEx supports programmatic advertising with cost-efficient, trust-minimized transactions and open algorithmic governance.

### Bitmedia’s crypto-focused approach

Bitmedia stands out with its exclusive focus on crypto audiences and blockchain projects. The platform offers a wide network of vetted publishers, contextual ad delivery, and flexible ad formats (HTML5, rich media, banners). Advertisers select pay-per-click (CPC) or pay-per-mille (CPM) models. High-end publisher placement and smart targeting (interests, demographics, behaviors) maximize ROAS for crypto campaigns. Bitmedia also leverages AI to optimize campaign effectiveness and reach.

### Varanida’s anti-fraud mechanisms

Varanida leverages blockchain for transparent, immutable ad and campaign reporting. Its anti-fraud system utilizes a chain-based verification framework so that advertisers and publishers have clear, unalterable logs of events and transactions, greatly reducing the opportunities for manipulation or false reporting. Varanida’s design includes strict campaign validation and robust user and publisher verification layers.

### Analyze Adshares blockchain architecture

Adshares offers a highly modular, scalable blockchain protocol dedicated to all forms of digital and virtual advertising—websites, games, apps, and billboards. Its architecture includes:

- Peer-to-peer, decentralized ad marketplace for direct publisher-advertiser deals.
- Standardized APIs for seamless onboarding and campaign management.
- On-chain algorithmic components (AdClassify, AdUser, AdSelect, AdPay) for ad matching, payment valuation, content classification, and traffic integrity (bot detection).
- Micropayments and reputation management for risk minimization and yield optimization.
- Minimal intermediaries, open APIs, and support for third-party module

### Study Ad-402 X402 implementation

The X402 payment protocol introduces blockchain- and token-agnostic micropayments between agents, integrating HTTP status code 402 (“Payment Required”). The X402 extension allows seamless, API-driven monetization within agent-based systems without user registration. The payment flow includes payment-required, payment-submitted, and payment-completed messages, enabling autonomous service monetization with on-chain verification.

### THEMIS privacy-preserving approach

THEMIS is a decentralized, privacy-by-design ad ecosystem. It employs smart contracts along with zero-knowledge proofs to allow auditable, trustless ad serving and reporting while fully protecting user privacy. Advertisers can verify campaign performance cryptographically, while users receive rewards for viewing ads—without any party knowing the user’s identity or behavior. THEMIS’s architecture is scalable (multi-sidechain capable), supporting 50M+ concurrent users with transparent and auditable rewards/distribution.

### Idena’s proof-of-person model

Idena’s consensus uses “Proof of Personhood,” where participants undergo periodic “flip” validation—unique, logic-based puzzles (flips) solvable only by humans. Each participant submits flips and solves them in synchronized validation rounds, ensuring network identity uniqueness without centralized authorities or sensitive ID collection. This model is robust against Sybil attacks and secures fair on-chain resource allocation by tying votes, rewards, or ad views to real individuals.

### Study Coinzilla’s crypto ad network

Coinzilla targets the crypto finance sector, with a network serving 16,000+ campaigns and 15,000+ advertisers. The network focuses on impression volume via finance/crypto websites and delivers conventional targeting options (geo, device, content type). While targeting is traditional (no wallet or behavioral filters), Coinzilla’s strength lies in its publisher reach and campaign management tools, delivering visible results for prominent Web3 projects.

### Research A-Ads anonymous campaigns

A-Ads, formerly Anonymous Ads, specializes in privacy-first, anonymous crypto ad campaigns. It dispenses with personal data collection and tracking (no cookies, JavaScript, or pop-ups), offering only non-intrusive banners for crypto audiences. Supported by multiple cryptocurrencies, A-Ads runs on cost-per-day (CPD), CPA, and CPM plans with no minimum budget, worldwide reach, and anonymous campaign management. The transparency and privacy model makes it ideal for privacy-focused advertisers, down to affiliate/referral programs paid in Bitcoin—without any compromise on user anonymity.
