- Other blockchain ad networks (competitive analysis)

14. LICENSE COMPATIBILITY
--------------------------

Most Important:
- OpenZeppelin: MIT (compatible)
- wagmi: MIT (compatible)
- ethers.js: MIT (compatible)
- X402: Check Coinbase license
- Adshares: Check license
- Ad-402: Check ETHGlobal license

Action: Verify licenses before use in production.

15. RECOMMENDED STUDY ORDER
----------------------------

1. First: Coinbase X402 repo (understand protocol)
2. Second: Ad-402 implementation (see X402 in practice)
3. Third: Adshares AdServer (ad network architecture)
4. Fourth: OpenZeppelin contracts (smart contract patterns)
5. Fifth: M2M protocol (BASE integration)

16. NEXT STEPS
--------------

1. Clone and study Coinbase X402 repo
2. Review Ad-402 ETHGlobal implementation
3. Study Adshares AdServer codebase
4. Review OpenZeppelin Escrow contracts
5. Set up development environment with these tools
6. Start building with these building blocks

17. SUMMARY
-----------

Available Building Blocks:
- ✅ X402 protocol implementations (Coinbase official)
- ✅ Complete ad network solutions (Adshares, EthicalAds)
- ✅ Smart contract libraries (OpenZeppelin)
- ✅ Web3 integration (wagmi, ethers.js)
- ✅ Reference implementations (Ad-402, M2M)
- ✅ Infrastructure tools (Hardhat, IPFS, TimescaleDB)

Key Finding: Significant open-source infrastructure exists that can accelerate Buzzer Network development. Primary focus should be on:
1. X402 protocol integration (Coinbase repo)
2. Smart contract building blocks (OpenZeppelin)
3. Reference implementations (Ad-402, Adshares)
4. Web3 tooling (wagmi, ethers.js)

This should significantly reduce development time and provide proven patterns.
