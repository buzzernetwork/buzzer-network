DOMAIN ANALYSIS - AD NETWORK & BLOCKCHAIN INTEGRATION
======================================================

1. TRADITIONAL AD NETWORK ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------------------

Key Components:
- Ad Server: Core system that selects and delivers ads
- Ad Exchange: Marketplace where ads are bought/sold programmatically
- DSP (Demand-Side Platform): Advertiser tools to buy ad inventory
- SSP (Supply-Side Platform): Publisher tools to sell ad inventory
- Ad Network: Aggregates inventory and matches with advertisers
- Advertisers: Entities paying to display ads
- Publishers: Websites/apps displaying ads

Revenue Models:
- CPM (Cost Per Mille): Pay per 1000 impressions
- CPC (Cost Per Click): Pay per click
- CPA (Cost Per Action): Pay per conversion
- Revenue Share: Typically 30-50% to network, 50-70% to publisher

Current Pain Points:
- High intermediary fees (Google takes 30-40%, Facebook takes 30%)
- Payment delays (net-30, net-60 payment terms)
- Lack of transparency in bidding
- Data privacy concerns
- Publisher revenue volatility

2. X402 PROTOCOL STANDARDS
---------------------------

X402 Protocol Overview:
- Open standard for internet-native payments using HTTP 402 status code
- Enables seamless crypto payments via API without registration, emails, OAuth, or complex signatures
- Zero fees at protocol level
- Instant settlement (blockchain speeds, seconds)
- Blockchain agnostic (not tied to specific chain)
- Frictionless integration (single line of middleware code)
- Supports micropayments (ideal for impression-based ad payments)

Technical Implementation:
- HTTP 402 status code: "Payment Required" - standard way to request payment
- Middleware-based approach: Single line of code integration
- API-first design: Works with existing web server stacks
- No registration required: Wallet-based authentication
- Instant settlement: Payments processed at blockchain speed

Technical Requirements:
- Ad metadata on-chain (optional, can be off-chain)
- Impression tracking via oracles (optional, for premium verification)
- Fraud prevention mechanisms
- Privacy-preserving analytics
- Standardized bidding interfaces

Integration Points:
- Smart contracts for payment escrow
- Oracle services for impression verification (optional)
- IPFS/Arweave for ad creative storage
- Layer 2 solutions for scalability (BASE)
- X402 SDK for easy integration

Resources:
- GitHub: Coinbase X402 Official Repo (https://github.com/coinbase/x402) - PRIMARY REFERENCE
- GitHub: x402-sdk (SDKs for payment protocol)
- GitHub: x402-ai-starter (Vercel Labs - Next.js integration example)
- GitHub: awesome-x402 (curated X402 resources)
- Documentation: x402.org
- Whitepaper: https://www.x402.org/x402-whitepaper.pdf

Important Note:
- X402 protocol has NO native token - it uses existing stablecoins (USDC on BASE)
- BUZZ token is project-specific to Buzzer Network, not part of X402 protocol
- X402 is payment infrastructure, BUZZ is utility/governance token for the network
